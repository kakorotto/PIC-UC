/*
4) Design a PIC program to control a DC-motor of a stone grinding machine using one start pushbutton (PB)
and one stop PB. Just pressing start PB, the motor executes cycle of operation according to the following
sequence:
a. motor rotate in the CW direction for 10T
b. motor temporarily stopping for 4T
c. motor rotate in the CCW direction for 7T
d. motor temporarily stopping for 3T
The motor has to repeat its cycle of operation continually till pressing stop PB which stops its operation
immediately.
Make your program assigns a value for (T) from the values (2, 3, 6, 8 sec.) by pressing a single pushbutton
every time.
